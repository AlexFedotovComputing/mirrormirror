# Sample configuration for the mirror orientation notebook
# semi_major and semi_minor are semi-axes of the ellipse (in meters or any unit)
semi_major=2.0
semi_minor=1.0

# Direction vector of the incoming ray (points toward the mirror)
incoming_direction=0, 0, -1

# Two points that lie on the reflected ray; the first one is assumed to be the reflection point on the mirror
reflected_point1=0, 0, 0
reflected_point2=1, 1, 1

# Optional: explicit mirror center (defaults to reflected_point1 if omitted)
mirror_center=0, 0, 0
